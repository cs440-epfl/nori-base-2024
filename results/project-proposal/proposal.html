Scene description and motivation
================================

Describe the scene you plan to render. Use at least one motivational image.


Feature list
============

Using the table below, list the features you'll use to achieve your render, and how they are used.

* Include the point counts, they should add up to at least 80 points with at least one medium feature (or harder). 

* We remind you that many advanced features (30 points or more) might be harder to implement than they seem at first sight. Unlike the rendering competition, the grading of the project solely depends on the correctness of the code and the validation in the report. A visually impressive render with a wrong implementation or insufficient validation may receive a harsh grade.

        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Identifier</th>

        <td>#S-abc</td>
